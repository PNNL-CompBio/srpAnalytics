chemical mapping: 
bottle.id: (String) An identifier for the bottle. Name of column must include a period. If missing, use NA,
chemical.id: (String) An identifier for the chemical. Name of column must include a period. These identifiers must be the same as in the morpohology/behavioral files.
chemical.name: (String) The chemical name, written with underscores for chemicals instead of commas. 1,2-dibromoethane should be 1_2-dibromoethane. If missing, use NA. 
casrn: (String) The CAS number if applicable. If missing, use NA.
