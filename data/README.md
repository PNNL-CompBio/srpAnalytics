## Data directory
This directory contains existing data and references files to be added to the SRP analytics database. These data are not private in any way, but mainly serve as reference files for the broader repository.

### Data Schema file
Incoming data requires a pre-defined schema so we can validate things
BEFORE they are going to be processed by our pipeline. This schema
also enables an easy way to check if a file CAN be processed before
adding it to the list.

### Data file manifest
The data file manifest contains a link to all the other data files,
including those referenced in this document. This file can be found
[here](./srp_build_files.csv).
